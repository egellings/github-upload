	 "I believe that I am a great candidate because I gain most job satisfaction from challenging myself, always improving and seeing my team continually improve"
 
 Why do you want to work here?
  - Give two main reasons: reputation, products/services

If someone in your team was not pulling their weight, what would you do?

  - Solve it with confident, tact and goal in mind (full capacity work)
		"Situation can have a negative impact on team and organization. I'd like to tackle it asap using communication" 
		"I would speak to my colleague in private to understand what is affecting their ability to work at full capacity. It may be something temporal like not feeling well or personal issues, in which case I would support them."
		"Being aware of their underperforming, they should seek to quickly get back on track. If that were not the case, I would speak to my supervisor for advice."
		
When did you work as part of a team that failed?
		"Has happened only a small number of times. There's one particular team project that I would like to talk about."
		"In a previous job, I was part of a team that was involved in X. We set targets."
		"When launching, we realized we were ineffecive"
		"The reason? Not sufficient research into X"
		"I was devastated. We worked extra hard to get back on track"
		"Every single team member was responsible and I learned a lot about the importance of attention to detail, cross-checking and double-checking is always vital"
		"I will always take ownership of problems and seek to solve them quickly and attentively."
		
Tell me what you do when you are not at work?
  - Are you productive and lead a responsible life?
  - Are you depleting your energy levels, affecting energy levels at work?
		"When not at work, I spend time with friends, reading, or keeping myself fit, or volunteering."
		"I like to relax by reading, crocheting, and during my daily yoga routine"
		"I keep healthy through sports: lately ulitmate frisbee and going to the gym, as well as biking 10km to work every day"
		"In RI I work with great teams that give me energy. My leadership positions and volunteer opportunities help me to continue learning and developing in areas beyond my job"

Tell me about a time when you didn't get on with a manager or supervisor?
  - We all had situations like that, it's how you reacted that's important
		"In one of my jobs I didn't get on well with my supervisor."
		"I usually get on well with the people I work with. I would never get such a situation get in the way of my professionalism and my ability to work hard towards the common goal of the team and organization."
		Example: PhD writing, very busy supervisor, chapter not discussed
		
Tell me about a time when you succeeded despite being under pressure?
  - Specific work situation
  - Odds stacked against you (e.g. time constraint)
  - Use STAR technique (situation, task, action, results)
		Situation: "In my last job, I was working as part of a team on a project with a very tight deadline"
		Task: "Our task was to ... within ... . Time was against me, but I was determined to succeed"
		Action: "At the start of the project, everyone got a specific task to complete by allocated deadlines. Unfortunately, halfway through the client changed their mind about an important aspect and we had to start again."
		"We decided to work an additional X hours "
		Result: "We got everything done by the additional hours"
		Example: antenna work: My PhD work focused on pushing the detection limit of individual molecules. For my last project, I developed an extremely sensitive setup. To round up the work, I wanted to characterize the sensitivity better using gold nanoantennas - since they give a stronger signal. This was meant to be a 1-2 day in the lab project before dedicating all my time to thesis writing. However, the antenna signal differed a lot from the molecular signal due to different physical phenomena governing it. No literature was available to satisfactorily describe the signal despite them often being studied in similar settings. I decided to push it. Pull 10 hour working days - either in the lab, understanding existing literature - physics behind it widely unknown to me, or exchanging ideas with colleagues and spend evenings and weekends writing the thesis. The antenna work ended up being the largest chapter of my thesis, including qualitative models that are mirrored by the systematic study I did, varying four different parameters. In the end, I completed the thesis one week before deadline, and was highly congratulated on it by experts in the field that were on my thesis committee. 
		
I believe that I would be a great fit for 3 reasons: my A, B, and C. number 1: I have been doing X for years, proving skill A.
Flexibility and adaptability
Increased responsibility

In what ways would you make an impact to the team?
  - very specifically, because I bring a different perspective
  - diverse point of view, having worked... bigger picture, different roles and personalities,

What is important that has not been addressed yet?
  - Although I have not worked in X previously, I have a deep background in ... I am confident that I will excel
